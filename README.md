## Populating the Database

## Step 1 - Creating the database and the first collection

Create a database called `library` in Compass with 1 collection authors.

## Step 2 - Creating the second collection

Create another collection called `books`.

## Step 3 - Import the data into the collections.

Download the 2 json files of this repository. From within Compass, select the books collection and click on "collection" in the top menu. Click on 'import' and select the books.json file. Do the same for authors.

You're done. ;)
